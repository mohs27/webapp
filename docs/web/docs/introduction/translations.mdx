# Translations

Several people have translated HoloPlay into different languages :

- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 English (default)
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇯🇵 Japanese
- 🇷🇺 Russian
- 🇩🇪 German

Thank you to all of them for their contribution 🙏

## Add new language

Add your own language by submitting a pull request to the [HoloPlay App repository](https://github.com/stephane-r/holoplay-pwa/pulls).

1. Create your new language file in `src/translations` by copying the `en.json` file
2. Translate the content of the file
3. Then, load your new language in `src/translations/index.ts` :

```ts
...
// 1. Import your JSON file
import fr from './fr.json';

// 2. Add your language code
export type Languages = ... | "fr-FR";

// 3. Add your language to the list (list of languages in the settings screen)
export const languagesValues = [
  ...
  {
    value: "fr-FR",
    label: "French",
  },
];

// 4. Add your language to the i18n resources
export const resources = {
  ...
  fr: {
    translation: fr,
  },
};
```

That's it ! 🎉
