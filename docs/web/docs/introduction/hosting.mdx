# Hosting

HoloPlay can be easy deployed as a static website on **your own server** or service like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Cloudeflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) or [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Their are three ways to host HoloPlay :

## Build from source

You can build HoloPlay by cloning the [Github repository](https://github.com/stephane-r/holoplay-pwa).

:::info
You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to build it
:::

First, install project dependencies :

```bash
npm i
```

Then, build the project :

```bash
npm run build
```

The build source is located in the `build` folder. You can now deploy it on your server and serve this folder as a static website.

## Download the latest Github Release

You can download the latest build from [Github Release](https://github.com/stephane-r/holoplay-pwa/releases) and deploy it on your server.

This is the same steps from the previous method, but builded on the Github CI.

## Docker

All release are builded as a Docker image and pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/spout8301/holoplay). This is the method used to setup HoloPlay with [CasaOs App Store](https://github.com/WisdomSky/CasaOS-LinuxServer-AppStore). 

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 spout8301/holoplay:latest
```

Or locally:

```bash
docker build -t holoplay .
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 holoplay
```
